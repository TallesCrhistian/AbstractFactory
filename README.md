# Abstract Factory Pattern in C#

This repository contains a simple example of implementing the Abstract Factory pattern in C#. The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that allows creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. It provides an interface for creating families of related objects without needing to know the specific classes of those objects.

How it works:

Abstract Interfaces: Defines abstract interfaces for factories of related objects, such as restaurants and foods.
Concrete Classes: Implements concrete classes for the abstract factories, creating specific related objects.
Dynamic Selection: Uses a dynamic selection mechanism (such as switches or strategies) to choose the concrete factory based on some criteria.
Object Creation: Utilizes the selected factories to create the actual objects.
This example includes creating restaurant factories for different types of cuisines (Japanese, Italian, etc.) and food factories for different types of dishes (pizza, sashimi, etc.).

Feel free to explore the source code and understand how the Abstract Factory pattern can be implemented in a real-world context.
